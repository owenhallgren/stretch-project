# Pear - A Github PR Review Solution

A [Front-End Project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/stretch.html) by [Jeff Shepherd](https://github.com/JeffShepherd), [Owen Hallgren](https://github.com/OwenHallgren), and [Josh Aragon](https://github.com/JoshAragon)


## Overview
Pear was our stretch project where we were able to choose new technologies that we would learn and implement in a span of 10 days. As front-end students we decided to learn a bit about the backend and learn PostgreSQL and Knex.js.

## Planning Resources

* [Github Project Board](https://github.com/owenhallgren/stretch-project/projects/2)

* [Miro (Wireframe)](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lKpikHM=/)

## Installation Instructions

1. Install and start the backend [here](https://github.com/owenhallgren/stretch-api)
2. `$ npm i`
3. `$ npm start`

If you see Compiled successfully! in your terminal, the application is running and the app can be viewed at http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.


## Learning Goals
* Learn about backend
* Solidify React skills
* Solidify router skills

##  Challenges

- Utilizing a postgreSQL database for the first time
- Leveraging Knex libraries and the intricate configurations involved
- Brief timeline to learn, and implement, new technologies
- All team members having to attend medical or COVID vaccine appointments

## Wins

- Implementing multiple new technologies in a brief period
- Adding a feature to send email notifications when the status of a review changes
- Surpassing the MVP

## Future Iterations

- Integrate login page with credential checking
- Gamify app to make users more likely to review other's requests
- Refactor application to use React hooks
